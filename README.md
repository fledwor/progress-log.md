# Base Builder Journey 🚀

This repository documents my ongoing learning and development journey as I explore blockchain technology and the Base ecosystem.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Practice consistent Git version control
- Document progress while learning Web3 development
- Explore smart contract fundamentals
- Track experiments and tools used in the Base ecosystem

## 🧠 Learning Focus
Currently studying and experimenting with:

- Solidity smart contract basics
- Contract deployment workflows
- Gas optimization concepts
- EVM compatibility
- Transaction lifecycle
- Remix IDE development
- Base network tools and infrastructure

## 🛠 Tools & Platforms
- GitHub (version control practice)
- Remix IDE
- Base Network
- BaseScan Explorer
- Web3 Wallets

## 📈 Progress Log
Development notes and learning milestones are recorded in **builder-log.md**.

This log tracks:
- Concepts studied
- Development experiments
- Workflow improvements
- Daily progress

## 🚀 Vision
Building foundational knowledge to grow into smart contract development and Web3 application building on Base.
